The dataset can be found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/regression-with-neural-networking/data
This project was small and mainly for me to test out pytorch a little.

I could not get a better RMSE score of about 8. Which is decent and better than most people on kaggle using a Neural Netwrok. However for regression there are better approaches such as XGBoost and Refression Trees.
On kaggle XGBoost seems to be the way to go, but NN is more fun.
